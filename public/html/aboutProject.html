          I am a computer science undergraduate aspiring to become a software engineer post-graduation, I often describe coding as "sweet torture." 
          Despite the challenges and stress that come with it, the feeling of relief and accomplishment upon solving a problem makes the journey incredibly rewarding

        Description of frameworks and APIs used
    </b>
    <br>
    <p>
        The JavaScript framework Vue 3 was used for the frontend of this project. Node.js was used
        for the backend / querying the database. The express Node.js framework Express was used to
        develop our custom API. The public Nominatim API was used by the frontend to search for
        locations by name and the retrieval of coordinates. This was needed for to render the map
        properly and update the table as users scroll around on the map.

        Six Things That We Learned
    </b>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Vue is reactive. Updating ref.value from the script propogates the change into the template.
        </li>
        <li>
            JSON.stringify() can be used to send an object as the body for a PUT request.
        </li>
        <li>
            Adding forms in Vue is extremely easy and adding the "required" property on an input
            will result in an error message box appearing on the input if a user trys to submit
            the form with that input empty.
        </li>
    </ol>
